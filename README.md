# GGD

There lists three .ipynb files. 

'Example of ijcnn' refers to the codes of ggd, ggd-adam and ggd-svrg for obtaining the experiment results of ijcnn dataset. Since we run logistic regression problem on ijcnn, a9a, covtype and rcv1, similar results can be obtained using this file with slight modifications. 

'Example of cifar10' refers to the codes of ggd, ggd-adam and ggd-svrg for obtaining the experiment results of cifar-10 dataset. Since we train two neural networks on mnist and cifar-10 datasets respectively, experiment results of mnist dataset can be obtained similarily.

'Example of onr' gives the codes of ggd, ggd-adam and ggd-svrg for solving linear regression problem on onr dataset.
